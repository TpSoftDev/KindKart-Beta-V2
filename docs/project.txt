Frontend
1.	Landing Page:
o	Use React for dynamic rendering of components.
o	Use the Google Maps API to display markers for food pantries from the database.
o	Use useEffect to fetch and render food pantry locations when a zip code is entered.
o	Clicking on a marker will open a pop-up/modal with detailed information fetched from the backend.
2.	Account Creation:
o	Create two separate forms:
	User Form (Name, Email, Phone Number).
	Food Pantry Form (Name, Email, Description, Contact, and Location—use Google Maps' "Place Autocomplete" or HTML Geolocation API for this).
o	Use useState to manage form input values.
3.	Favorites Management:
o	Display a "Favorites" section for users after logging in.
o	Use conditional rendering in React to show/hide "Favorites" based on authentication.
4.	Styling:
o	Use CSS for custom design or integrate Bootstrap/Tailwind for faster, responsive layouts.
 
Backend
Node.js + Express Backend:
1.	APIs for User Management:
o	POST /user/register: Create a new user.
o	POST /user/login: Authenticate returning users.
o	GET /user/favorites: Retrieve a user’s favorite food pantries.
o	PUT /user/favorites: Add/remove food pantries to/from favorites.
2.	APIs for Pantry Management:
o	POST /pantry/register: Add a new food pantry.
o	GET /pantry/nearby: Fetch food pantries near a given zip code.
o	GET /pantry/details/:id: Retrieve details for a specific food pantry.
3.	Middleware:
o	Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
o	Validate requests with middleware for security (e.g., checking user permissions for favorites).
4.	Database Structure:
o	Users Collection/Table:
	User ID
	Name
	Email
	Phone Number
	Favorites (array of pantry IDs)
o	Food Pantries Collection/Table:
	Pantry ID
	Name
	Description
	Location (latitude/longitude)
	Contact Information
	Images
 
Database
•	Use MongoDB for its flexibility with geospatial data (e.g., 2dsphere index for searching nearby locations).
•	Alternatively, use MySQL with a proper schema for storing food pantry details and geolocation data.
 
Key Technologies/Requirements Used
1.	Frontend:
o	React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management and fetching data.
o	Google Maps API for location-based features.
2.	Backend:
o	Node.js + Express for REST API implementation.
o	Async/await for handling asynchronous operations like database calls.
3.	Database:
o	CRUD operations implemented (Create: new user/pantry; Read: search pantries; Update: favorites; Delete: remove pantry).
4.	Optional Enhancements:
o	Add Tailwind CSS for faster styling.
o	Save images (e.g., food pantry photos) in Cloudinary or an S3 bucket to reduce database storage.
