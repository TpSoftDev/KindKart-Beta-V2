Current Progress
1. Frontend Setup:
Landing Page: Users can enter a zip code and navigate to a map page.
Map Page: Displays a Google Map centered around the first location from the fetched data.
Map Component: Fetches food pantry locations from the backend and displays them as markers on the map.
Backend Setup:
Express Server: Serves a /locations endpoint that returns sample food pantry data.
CORS Enabled: Allows the frontend to make requests to the backend without CORS issues.
3. Testing:
Verified that the frontend can successfully fetch data from the backend.
Used Postman to test the /locations endpoint.
